# Robustness analysis of Dolphin and Jazz networks

The  main  objective  of  this  paper  is  to  ascertain  the  robustness  in  erroneousnetworks.   In  this  paper,  we  have  generated  Kronecker  graphs  using  kronfit  andkrongen algorithms based on the real-world networks, Dolphins and Jazz.  We haveused  error  mechanisms  add  edge,  remove  edge,  add  node,  remove  node  to  createerroneous networks using different centrality measures like degree, eigenvector andpagerank.  We have calculated robustness for the generated Kronecker graphs alongwith original networks and we used these robustness to compare the robustness ofthe  generated  kronecker  graphs  of  different  sizes.   Robustness  is  calculated  usingKendallâ€™s  Tau  correlation  by  comparing  order  list  of  centrality  values  of  hiddenand measure kronecker graphs.  Throughout the paper, we have implemented anddiscussed robustness by generating error networks using 10% and 30% error levelswith error mechanisims.  From the observations, we have found that Dolphins net-work robustness is not as responsive to network size compared to Jazz network.  Weobserved that removing nodes error mechanism has proven to produce robustnessvalues closer to the original network.
